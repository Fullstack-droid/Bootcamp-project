Bootcamp Q4 22
## Intro ##
We created a coding version of the classic game hangman, played in schools on a (green)whiteboard.

## Basic rules  ##  
- guessed the word according to the _ displayed,
- the player wins if guesses the word or sentence,
- the player loses if s/he tries more than the max. amount of guesses (6).

The game starst by asking the player if s/he wants to play the game, 
a random word is picked from our dic of words and a number of _ is shown accordingly,
a post will hang the man if 6 guesses are wrong.

Have fun and save the man!
